	<h3> #section 1</h3>
		<p>A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set
	of programs to access those data. The collection of data, usually referred to as the
	database, contains information relevant to an enterprise. The primary goal of a DBMS
	is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient
	and efficient.
	Database systems are designed to manage large bodies of information. Management
	of data involves both defining structures for storage of information and providing
	mechanisms for the manipulation of information. In addition, the database system
	must ensure the safety of the information stored, despite system crashes or attempts
	at unauthorized access. If data are to be shared among several users, the system must
	avoid possible anomalous results.
	Because information is so important in most organizations, computer scientists
	have developed a large body of concepts and techniques for managing data. These
	concepts and techniques form the focus of this book. This chapter briefly introduces
	the principles of database systems.</p>

	<h3> #section 2 </h3>
	<p style="color: white">Database-System Applications<br>
	The earliest database systems arose in the 1960s in response to the computerized management
	of commercial data. Those earlier applications were relatively simple compared
	to modern database applications. Modern applications include highly sophisticated,
	worldwide enterprises.
	All database applications, old and new, share important common elements. The
	central aspect of the application is not a program performing some calculation, but
	rather the data themselves. Today, some of the most valuable corporations are valuable
	not because of their physical assets, but rather because of the information they own.
	Imagine a bank without its data on accounts and customers or a social-network site
	that loses the connections among its users. Such companiesâ€™ &nsbp; value would be almost
	totally lost under such circumstances.</p>
